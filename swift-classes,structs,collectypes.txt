Here's a brief overview of Swift Classes and Structures:

> Classes:

- Classes are reference types and allow inheritance.
- -A class can have properties, methods and initializers.
- When an object of a class is created, it is stored in the heap.
- Classes can have a destructor to free up memory when an object is no longer in use.
- Classes can have reference cycles which can lead to memory leaks.


> Structures:

- Structures are value types and do not allow inheritance.
- A structure can have properties, methods and initializers.
- When a structure is assigned to a variable, its value is copied.
- Structures cannot have a destructor to free up memory.
- Structures are less prone to memory leaks due to the way they are stored in memory.


> Collection Types:

- Collection types are used to store collections of values.
- Swift has 3 main collection types: Arrays, Dictionaries and Sets.
- Arrays store values in order and allow duplicates.
- Dictionaries store values with a key and do not allow duplicates.
- Sets store values with no duplicates and no order.
